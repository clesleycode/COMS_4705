## Part 1 

In a file named `part1.py`, write code to process the Brown Corpus and then find answers to the following questions:

1) Write a list, named `nouns`, which contains five nouns that are more common in their plural form than their singular form.
2) Which word has the greatest number of distinct tags? What are they? Assign this word to the variable `g_word` and print its tag.
3) Write a tags in order of decreasing frequency.

By now you have been exposed to Python's `nltk` module, which you can find documentation for [here](http://www.nltk.org/). In this part of the assignment, use the `nltk` to find the parts of speech of the following sentences: 

1. "The apple is green in color where green is a color"
